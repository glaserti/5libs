You step out of the seminar room and ponder, "Where could the English/American Studies library be?" You turn around.

* You ask a student who is just walking down the hallway.
    "The English library? No idea. English Studies is over in the towers. The library is probably there too."
    -> ToTheEngStudLib_E.WrongWay_E
* You approach a small group of students standing next to you.
    "Can you tell me where to find the English/American Studies library?"
    "Yes, well, actually no. It doesn't exist anymore. It used to be in the towers, where English Studies is. Then it was moved into the main library. You'll find the books there."

You head over to the towers. Across the Lahn bridge, past the cafeteria, along the long Hermann-Cohen-Weg, until you stand in front of the PhilFak, the towers. "Nice here," you think. "Studying right between the highway and the railroad tracks. Quite an achievement." In the PhilFak, you search for the English Studies tower. But on the floor plan, you see no sign of the library. Then the elevator door opens, and out steps someone who doesnâ€™t look like a professor: a middle-aged person with a mop of curly hair and a hoodie. "Or is he a professor?" You start to doubt.
    * You ask him if he knows where the library is.
        "The library is in the main library. You can find the English Studies books there."
        -> MainLibrary_E
    * Ask a professor? No way!
        You decide to search every floor. The library must be somewhere.
        You finally find a door labeled "Library." As you get closer, you see a sign hanging on the door. The sign says that the library is now located in the main library.

            You check your watch. You have {MinutesLeft} minutes left until your next {~class|lecture|session}.
  -   So, you head back across the Lahn to the main library.

    On each floor, you check the floor plan again.
    1st floor: nothing!

    You see

    You search for the title:

Hmm, the book isn't here. Did you write down the wrong call number? You go back to the catalog PC and search for the title again.
